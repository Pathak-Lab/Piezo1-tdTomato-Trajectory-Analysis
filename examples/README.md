# Examples

For code testing purposes, we are providing four sample JSON arrays from the data reported in Ly et al.: two from untreated MEFs and two from MEFs after cholesterol supplementation. The files are too large to be distributed with this repository. Download as a zip from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zkg7y0nb76hZiEosA3w9jnt60qIlpaz0/view?usp=sharing) and unzip in this directory.

The trajectory RDS files under `untreated/` and `cholesterol/` were generated by running the following at the command line from `get_trajectories`:
```bat
for i in untreated cholesterol
> do
> Rscript getTrajs.R 200 ../examples/jfilenamesList_${i} ../examples/jsonFiles ../examples/$i json > ../examples/out.traj.$i 2>&1 &
> done
```
check the comments in `getTrajs.R` for details on the execution line.

The feature calculations under `untreated/` and `cholesterol/` were performed by running the following as a shell script from `compute_features`: 
```bat
for i in untreated cholesterol
do
  Rscript getsRg.R ${i}-sRg 200 ../examples/jfilenamesList_${i} ../examples/$i ../examples/$i > out.srg.$i 2>&1 &
  Rscript getTAMSD.R 20 ${i}-TAMSD  200 ../examples/jfilenamesList_${i} ../examples/$i ../examples/$i > out.tamsd.$i 2>&1 &
  Rscript getStepsNormalized.R  $i 200 ../examples/jfilenamesList_${i} ../examples/$i ../examples/$i > out.stepnorm.$i 2>&1 &
  Rscript getStepLengthsDelta.R  200 ../examples/jfilenamesList_${i} 1 ../examples/$i ../examples/$i > out.steplen.$i 2>&1 &
done
```
check the comments in each script for details on the execution line.
