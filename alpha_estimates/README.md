# Alpha Estimates

Generate anomalous exponent (e.g. TAMSD vs. lag power-law exponent) mean and standard deviation estimates from an ensemble of heterogeneous diffusers as presented in Kepten et al PRE 2013 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.052713

- `getKepten.R`: An R function implementing the method described in Kepten et al. It also generates plots that could help assessing the quality of the estimates.
- `keptenEstimates.ipynb`: Illustrates the calculation using the mobile trajectories TAMSD RDS files under `example/` generated by  `ImmobileMobile_generate.ipynb`.
