# Mix models

`generate_StepDistr.ipynb` is a notebook created with JupyterLab with an R kernel illustrating the scaled-step distribution analysis reported in Ly et al. Figure 3 (see also eq. 3) using the trajectories' step calculations saved to an RDS file under `example/untreated`.

`mixture-d1throughd3-260_untreated.nb` is a Mathemacia notebook illustrating the mixture modeling of trajectory step-length distrutions as reported in Ly et al. (see eq. 4) using the trajectories' step-length calculations saved as text files file under `example/untreated` by `getStepLenDatFiles.R`.

`mixture-d1throughd3-analyses-260_untreated.nb` is a Mathematica notebook analyzing the mixture modeling results (see Ly et al. Figures 4 and 6).
