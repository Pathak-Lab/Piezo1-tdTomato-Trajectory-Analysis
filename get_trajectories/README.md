# Get Trajectories

## Steps to extract trajectories from JSON arrays generated by Flika and to save them as R objects

- Prepare a list of JSON file names without extension as a text file (e.g. JSONs from different experimental sessions).
- Run `getTrajs.R` at the command line as indicated in the scripts comments (note that the script requires a minimum trajectory length cutoff).
- The output will be one RDS file per JSON file containing a list of all the trajecories of length >= cutoff 
  - each list element is a 2-column matrix with position vector components columnwise
  - missing positions are encoded as NA
  - the name of each list element is the name of the JSON file + the track index in the JSON
