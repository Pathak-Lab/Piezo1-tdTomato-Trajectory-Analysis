# Get Trajectories

## Steps to extract trajectories from JSON arrays generated by Flika and save as R objects

- Prepare a list of JSON file names without extension as a text file (e.g. JSONs from different experimental sessions).
- Run `getTrajs.R` at the command line as indicated in the scripts comments
  - A minimum trajectory length cutoff is required by the script
